          <p>
            My initial interest in software development began in high school
            when I became the lead programmer for my robotics team. This early
            intrigue soon evolved into a profound passion, leading me to pursue
            a major in Computer Science at Northeastern University. During my
            time at Northeastern, I have gained both technical and leadership
            experience through class projects and two 6-month co-op internships.
            Additionally, I have found fulfillment in mentoring within the
            Computer Science Mentorship Organization (CoSMO), where I guide
            younger students towards achieving their academic and personal
            goals.

            Outside of my technical pursuits, I am deeply involved in music,
            leading several bands in Boston. I enjoy expressing myself through
            the saxophone and guitar, exploring a range of genres from funk and
            jazz to everything in between. Additionally, I love dedicating time
            to sailingâ€”a passion influenced by my upbringing in Newport, RI. My
            other interests include reading, playing fantasy football,
            experimenting with ergonomic keyboards, and staying up-to-date on
            the latest advancements in e-ink technology.

            I firmly believe in the importance of a strong work ethic and
            consistency. These principles are central to my approach to life,
            propelling me to continually seek improvement and make a meaningful
            impact in all my endeavors. At my core lies a deep-seated curiosity
            that drives me to learn and grow. I am constantly on the lookout for
            new opportunities to challenge myself.
